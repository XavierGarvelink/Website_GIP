		<p>========== placeholder FAQ ==========</p>
		<dl> 
		<dt>Q: What does this mean?</dt>
		<dd>A: The amount of times I have had *censored* with your mom has increased by one.</dd>
		<br>
		<dt>Q: Why did you do this?</dt>
		<dd>A: There are several reasons I may *censored* your mom. These include, but are not limited to: Rudeness towards me Being shitty towards others Disagreeing with my opinion</dd>
		<br>
		<dt>Q: Am I going to be *censored* as well?</dt>
		<dd>A: yes.</p>
		<br>
		<dt>Q: I don't believe you should have *censored* my mom, can you un*censored* her</dt>
		<dd>A: Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I un*censored* someoneâ€™s mom. If you would like to issue an un*censored*, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of un*censored* appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.</dd>
		<br>
		<dt>Q: How can I prevent this from happening in the future?</dt>
		<dd>A: Accept that I *censored* your mom and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated. I will continue *censored* your mom until you improve your conduct. Remember: your mom not being *censored* is a privilege, not a right</dd>
